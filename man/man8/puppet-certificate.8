.TH "PUPPET\-CERTIFICATE" "8" "January 2019" "Puppet, Inc." "Puppet manual"
.
.SH "NAME"
\fBpuppet\-certificate\fR \- Provide access to the CA for certificate management\.
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
puppet certificate \fIaction\fR [\-\-terminus _TERMINUS] [\-\-extra HASH] \fI\-\-ca\-location LOCATION\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This subcommand interacts with a local or remote Puppet certificate authority\. Currently, its behavior is not a full superset of \fBpuppet cert\fR; specifically, it is unable to mimic puppet cert\'s "clean" option, and its "generate" action submits a CSR rather than creating a signed certificate\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Note that any setting that\'s valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument, although it may or may not be relevant to the present action\. For example, \fBserver\fR and \fBrun_mode\fR are valid settings, so you can specify \fB\-\-server <servername>\fR, or \fB\-\-run_mode <runmode>\fR as an argument\.
.
.P
See the configuration file documentation at \fIhttps://puppet\.com/docs/puppet/latest/configuration\.html\fR for the full list of acceptable parameters\. A commented list of all configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with \fB\-\-genconfig\fR\.
.
.TP
\-\-render\-as FORMAT
The format in which to render output\. The most common formats are \fBjson\fR, \fBs\fR (string), \fByaml\fR, and \fBconsole\fR, but other options such as \fBdot\fR are sometimes available\.
.
.TP
\-\-verbose
Whether to log verbosely\.
.
.TP
\-\-debug
Whether to log debug information\.
.
.TP
\-\-ca\-location LOCATION
Whether to act on the local certificate authority or one provided by a remote puppet master\. Allowed values are \'local\' and \'remote\.\'
.
.IP
This option is required\.
.
.TP
\-\-extra HASH
A terminus can take additional arguments to refine the operation, which are passed as an arbitrary hash to the back\-end\. Anything passed as the extra value is just send direct to the back\-end\.
.
.TP
\-\-terminus _TERMINUS
Indirector faces expose indirected subsystems of Puppet\. These subsystems are each able to retrieve and alter a specific type of data (with the familiar actions of \fBfind\fR, \fBsearch\fR, \fBsave\fR, and \fBdestroy\fR) from an arbitrary number of pluggable backends\. In Puppet parlance, these backends are called terminuses\.
.
.IP
Almost all indirected subsystems have a \fBrest\fR terminus that interacts with the puppet master\'s data\. Most of them have additional terminuses for various local data models, which are in turn used by the indirected subsystem on the puppet master whenever it receives a remote request\.
.
.IP
The terminus for an action is often determined by context, but occasionally needs to be set explicitly\. See the "Notes" section of this face\'s manpage for more details\.
.

\fBfind\fR \- Retrieve a certificate\.: \fBSYNOPSIS\fR

\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Retrieve a certificate\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
An x509 SSL certificate\.
.
.IP
Note that this action has a side effect of caching a copy of the certificate in Puppet\'s \fBssldir\fR\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBgenerate\fR \- Generate a new certificate signing request\.: \fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate generate [\-\-terminus _TERMINUS] [\-\-extra HASH] \fI\-\-ca\-location LOCATION\fR [\-\-dns\-alt\-names NAMES] \fIhost\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Generates and submits a certificate signing request (CSR) for the specified host\. This CSR will then have to be signed by a user with the proper authorization on the certificate authority\.
.
.IP
Puppet agent usually handles CSR submission automatically\. This action is primarily useful for requesting certificates for individual users and external applications\.
.
.IP
\fBOPTIONS\fR \fI\-\-dns\-alt\-names NAMES\fR \- A comma\-separated list of alternate DNS names for Puppet Server\. These are extra hostnames (in addition to its \fBcertname\fR) that the server is allowed to use when serving agents\. Puppet checks this setting when automatically requesting a certificate for Puppet agent or Puppet Server, and when manually generating a certificate with \fBpuppet cert generate\fR\. These can be either IP or DNS, and the type should be specified and followed with a colon\. Untyped inputs will default to DNS\.
.
.IP
In order to handle agent requests at a given hostname (like "puppet\.example\.com"), Puppet Server needs a certificate that proves it\'s allowed to use that name; if a server shows a certificate that doesn\'t include its hostname, Puppet agents will refuse to trust it\. If you use a single hostname for Puppet traffic but load\-balance it to multiple Puppet Servers, each of those servers needs to include the official hostname in its list of extra names\.
.
.IP
\fBNote:\fR The list of alternate names is locked in when the server\'s certificate is signed\. If you need to change the list later, you can\'t just change this setting; you also need to:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
On the server: Stop Puppet Server\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
On the CA server: Revoke and clean the server\'s old certificate\. (\fBpuppet cert clean <NAME>\fR) (Note \fBpuppet cert clean\fR is deprecated and will be replaced with \fBpuppetserver ca clean\fR in Puppet 6\.)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
On the server: Delete the old certificate (and any old certificate signing requests) from the ssldir \fIhttps://puppet\.com/docs/puppet/latest/dirs_ssldir\.html\fR\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
On the server: Run \fBpuppet agent \-t \-\-ca_server <CA HOSTNAME>\fR to request a new certificate
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
On the CA server: Sign the certificate request, explicitly allowing alternate names (\fBpuppet cert sign \-\-allow\-dns\-alt\-names <NAME>\fR)\. (Note \fBpuppet cert sign\fR is deprecated and will be replaced with \fBpuppetserver ca sign\fR in Puppet 6\.)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
On the server: Run \fBpuppet agent \-t \-\-ca_server <CA HOSTNAME>\fR to retrieve the cert\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
On the server: Start Puppet Server again\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.IP
To see all the alternate names your servers are using, log into your CA server and run \fBpuppet cert list \-a\fR, then check the output for \fB(alt names: \.\.\.)\fR\. Most agent nodes should NOT have alternate names; the only certs that should have them are Puppet Server nodes that you want other agents to trust\.
.
