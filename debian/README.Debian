puppet for Debian
------------------

The puppet agent service is disabled by default on new installations. To enable
the service after installation, run

 `systemctl enable puppet.service' or `update-rc.d puppet enable'

If you rely on other means for running puppet agent (e.g. cron), you should
leave the service disabled.
