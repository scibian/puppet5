puppet (4.8.2-2) unstable; urgency=high

  As of 4.8.2-2, the puppet service is not enabled by default on new
  installations and has to be manually enabled using

          systemctl enable puppet.service
  or
          update-rc.d puppet enable

  if desired. Note that upgrades from previous puppet versions are not
  affected by this change and will preserve the service status.

  Since some versions of the package shipped with the service enabled by
  default, if you are upgrading please check and make sure that the service on
  your system is properly enabled or disabled to match your preference.

puppet (4.8.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  The Ruby Puppet master as shipped in Debian can currently handle Puppet 3.x
  clients only when run under a rack-enabled web server. If you are using the
  standalone (WEBrick) puppet master from the puppetmaster package and want to
  support Puppet 3.x clients, please switch to using puppet-master-passenger
  instead.

  As always, you should upgrade the Puppet master first, and the clients
  afterwards. Puppet 4.x clients will not work against a Puppet 3.x master.

puppet (4.5.0-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  This is a major update of puppet, with significant changes from Puppet 3.
  Upgrade with care.

  Before you upgrade: A detailed list of what to do before upgrading to this
  version of puppet is available at
  https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/4.5/reference/upgrade_major_pre.html

  A summary of important changes:

    - Language changes: The puppet 4 language has a lot of new features, and
      is not entirely backwards compatible with puppet 3.

      You will likely need to test and change your puppet code, and verify
      that any modules you use are compatible with the Puppet 4 language.

    - Code directory: A "codedir" configuration setting is introduced as the
      root directory for puppet code. The default in Debian is
      "/etc/puppet/code".

      This is configurable by setting "codedir = /path/to/elsewhere" under
      "[main]" in /etc/puppet/puppet.conf

    - Environment path: Puppet 4 uses directory environments to organize code.
      By default, the root path for environments is in
      "$codedir/environments".

      This is configurable by setting "environmentpath = /path/to/somewhere"
      under "[main]" in /etc/puppet/puppet.conf

      The default "production" environment should be placed in
      "/etc/puppet/code/environments/production/". Examples are available in
      "/usr/share/doc/puppet/examples/environments/".

    - Exporting and collecting resources in Puppet 4 requires PuppetDB.  This
      is not yet packaged in Debian.

puppet (3.7.2-3) unstable; urgency=medium
 
  The START flag in /etc/default/puppet is since 3.2.4-1 no longer effective.
  To preserve state across upgrades for old setups where the puppet agent was
  disabled using the START flag, the agent will be disabled using its built-in
  disable facility if START is not set to true. In that case, you will need to
  run "puppet agent --enable" before the agent can connect to a puppet master.

  On systems running the puppet agent via cron, make sure that you do not rely
  on the START variable in /etc/default/puppet and instead disable the
  service using update-rc.d or systemctl.

puppet (3.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=high

  The puppet agent is now started by default, regardless of init system.

    - On a fresh installation, you will need to run "puppet agent --enable"
      before it will connect to a puppet master to retrieve its catalog.

puppet (3.1.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  Puppet 3.x introduces incompatible changes.
  
  For the puppet DSL, dynamic variable scoping has been removed. This
  means that your manifests may need changes to work as intended. See
  http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/scope_and_puppet.html

  Authorization of clients in /etc/puppet/auth.conf now matches client
  certificate names only. There is a new allow_ip keyword in auth.conf if
  you want to permit IP addresses.

  For the full list of changes, see:
  http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/Release_Notes#3.1.0

puppet (0.25.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  The pluginsync=true option is no longer set in the default puppet.conf
  that is distributed with the package. There is a spurious error that
  is thrown when this is enabled, and you have no plugins. Most people
  will eventually want this enabled, however for a new puppet installation
  it tends to scare people. Given the security implications of pluginsync
  (it can append to anything in RUBYLIB, not just puppet/facter related
  things), it is better to have it off by default, and let you decide
  when you want it enabled.

puppet (0.25.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The default location of the puppet template directory has been moved to
  /etc/puppet/templates from /var/lib/puppet/templates.
  
  If you use templates in your manifests, please either set "templatedir" in
  /etc/puppet/puppet.conf to the old location, or move your templates to the new
  location.
